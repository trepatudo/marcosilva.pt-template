My university experience was three years in the making when one of my personal projects was purchased by a bigger company. During the acquisition process I ended up being offered an irrecusable full-time job. I have it in my bucket list to go back to university and finish the course.

#+BEGIN_explanation
I was already coding for 5 years when my high-school experience started. Benefiting from an already deep understanding of the computers’ fundamentals, I coded a solution that provided cybercafés the ability to remotely control their own machines (using VB6 and PHP/MySQL). This school project granted me The Best Informatics Student award (and a 500EUR prizemoney).
